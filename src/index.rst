What Does Toltec Do?

Toltec gives you access to all the packages from the `Entware <https://entware.net/about.html>`_ and Toltec repositories.
Toltec keeps track of which apps you have installed and makes it easy to update or remove them.

        Use the **opkg** command to add, remove, and update packages from the command line.

    .. container::

        ::

            opkg update
            opkg upgrade

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Where can I get help?
    If you need help with Toltec or one of its packages, you can `start a discussion on GitHub <https://github.com/toltec-dev/toltec/discussions>`_ or `join the reMarkable community on Discord <https://discord.gg/ATqQGfu>`_.
    Please do not open issues to ask for help, as they're used exclusively for `package requests <https://github.com/toltec-dev/toltec/blob/testing/docs/contributing.md#requesting-a-package>`_ and `bug reports <https://github.com/toltec-dev/toltec/blob/testing/docs/contributing.md#reporting-a-bug>`_.

Is this supported by reMarkable AS?
    No, this is a community project.

Will this brick my reMarkable?
    Probably not, but `standard disclaimers apply <https://github.com/toltec-dev/toltec/blob/stable/LICENSE>`_.

Do you support reMarkable 2?
    Yes, Toltec will automatically detect whether you are using a reMarkable 1 or 2, and install the required framebuffer dependencies.

Why doesn't toltec support the latest OS version as soon as it comes out?
    Some of our packages require new versions to properly support a new OS release. For the reMarkable 2, the `display` needs to be updated so that any application that uses the screen will work. Without this being updated, you'll end up soft-bricking your device. Other packages like `ddvk-hacks` will just fail to install without having explicit support. Since this project is volunteer run, and we put things through a testing period before it can make it to stable, it can take a little while for us to catch up when new versions of the OS are being released.

Can I add `__________` to Toltec?
    We’re always open to adding new packages to the repository.
    You’ll find information about how to add a package in our `contributing guide <https://github.com/toltec-dev/toltec/blob/stable/docs/contributing.md>`_.

I found a vulnerability in Toltec or one of its packages, where can I report it?
    To inform the Toltec maintainers about a security issue, please follow the `security instructions <https://github.com/toltec-dev/organization/blob/main/docs/security.md>`_.

Can I factory reset my reMarkable if I have toltec installed?
    No, **DO NOT** factory reset your reMarkable if you have toltec installed. First uninstall toltec with ``toltecctl uninstall``.

Why can't I install toltec before my OS is supported?
    `Can I install toltec before my OS version is supported? <https://remarkable.guide/faqs.html#can-i-install-toltec-before-my-os-version-is-supported>`_ on `remarkable.guide <https://remarkable.guide>`_ has a good write-up on why.

Why doesn’t toltec support the beta OS versions?
    `Why doesn’t toltec support the beta OS versions? <https://remarkable.guide/faqs.html#why-doesn-t-toltec-support-the-beta-os-versions>`_ on `remarkable.guide <https://remarkable.guide>`_ has a good write-up on why.

My reMarkable seems to have become unresponsive, how do I fix it?
   If you can't SSH in through USB (using IP ``10.11.99.1``), there are tools that can help you recover your reMarkable if it becomes unresponsive:

   * reMarkable 1: `uuuflash <https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-uuuflash>`_
   * reMarkable 2: `remarkable2-recovery <https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable2-recovery>`_.
    
   If you can SSH in through USB, the following may work:

   .. parsed-literal::

      rm /etc/systemd/system/xochitl.service.d/toltec-wrapper.conf
      systemctl unmask sync.service || systemctl unmask rm-sync.service
      systemctl disable --now manual-sync.service
      systemctl daemon-reload
      systemctl reset-failed xochitl
      systemctl restart xochitl
